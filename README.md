        Update content in the project files (e.g., pages, components) as needed.
        Run npm run build to rebuild the project after making changes.

    Security Updates:

Additional Notes:

    Regularly review SSL certificate expiry dates and renew them before expiration.
    Utilize version control (Git) for tracking changes and collaborating with others on the project.
